## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the GitHub organization of the Robotics, Aerospace, and Information Networks (RAIN) Lab at the University of Washington! This lab is headed by professor Mehran Mesbahi, faculty at the Aerospace department at UW. This organization is made for members to add repos of their work. That way, all of your code will be available for the public in an organized and accessible way. 

I have permissions set so that all members can create their own repos and act as admins for it. In order to gain write permissions for other repo's, you need the permission of that repo's admin/creator. 

There are 3 rules you must follow for adding any code to a repo, including yours:
1. All methods and classes must be commented with an description of the functionality, the inputs, outputs, and their types.
2. The README.md must contain a sentence of each script in the repo that briefly explains what that script does
3. All scripts must run with no crashes.

Feel free to add anything to your repo, including PDFs of important papers and documents, videos, etc. Though please refrain from uploading huge databases. Try to keep your repo under 50 MB.
