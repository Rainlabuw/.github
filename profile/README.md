## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the GitHub organization of the Robotics, Aerospace, and Information Networks (RAIN) Lab at the University of Washington Aerospace department! This lab is headed by professor Mehran Mesbahi. This organization is made for members to add repos of their work. That way, all of your code will be available for the public in an organized and accessible way. 

All members can create their own repos as admins. In order to gain write permissions for other repos, you need the permission of an admin of that repo. 

There are 3 rules for uploading code to any repo, including yours:
1. All methods and classes must be commented with a description of the functionality, the inputs, outputs, and their types.
2. The README.md must must briefly explain the functionality of each script in that repo.
3. All scripts must run with no crashes.

Feel free to add anything to your repo, including PDFs of important papers and documents, videos, etc. Refrain from uploading huge databases. Try to keep your repo under 50 MB.
